# Movies App

[Click here](https://alejandro-pedrazaaa.github.io/MandM-Webpage/) to visit and interact with this application.

## Description

This application was inspired by the ["50projects50days"](https://github.com/bradtraversy/40projects40days)
challenge by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy). With the use of APIs, this app fetches information on the latest, most popular, and highest rated movies for the main screen. When the user clicks on any movie poster, a new page loads with information about that movie. Also, in that page the user can find either a collection of the movies related to the movie or similar movies. The application is resposive to the width of the screen. 

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the latest git version and the latest Visual Studio Code version
